# Data

This folder will have five subfolders:

- **input**: This contains the input data that will be used to generate the co-occurrence network
- **cleaned**: This contains the data that has been transformed and loaded into a format ready for network generation with FlashWeave
- **graph**: This contains the output graph generated by the co-occurrence network generation
- **edgelist**: This contains the edgelist of the full co-occurrence network, or subset to only edges with a specific group
- **circlize**: This contains edges to a nodes of a certain "focus group", which will be used to generate a circos plot of that focus group's interactions
